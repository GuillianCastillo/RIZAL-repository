            <p>
                In the context of Jose Rizal,
                 it refers to his willingness to face death rather than abandon his principles and love for the country. 
                 His execution showed that even without using violence, a person can become a powerful symbol of resistance. 
                 Rizal’s death awakened the Filipino people, strengthened their desire for freedom,
                 and inspired the revolution against oppression.
