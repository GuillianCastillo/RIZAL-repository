            <h1>Noli Me Tángere:</h1>

            <p>
              Noli Me Tángere, José Rizal's groundbreaking novel, 
              follows educated Filipino Crisóstomo Ibarra as he returns home from Europe, only to find corruption and injustice under Spanish colonial rule, particularly from abusive friars like Fray Dámaso, who caused his father's death. Ibarra's attempts to build a school and pursue his love, María Clara, are thwarted by these powers, leading to his excommunication and imprisonment, though he escapes with the help of the revolutionary Elias, who sacrifices himself. The story exposes societal ills,
               fueling Filipino nationalism and critiquing the oppressive friar-led government.
